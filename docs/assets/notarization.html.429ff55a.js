It is a three-part process that includes the vetting of a signer&#39;s identity, the signer testifying to the asset&#39;s <a href="#Statuses">status</a>, and the recording of that asset&#39;s metadata (signer identity, unique digital fingerprint, <a href="#Statuses">status</a>, etc.) into an official record stored on the blockchain. This way interested parties can authenticate with certainty if an asset is trusted, who testified to its trust and how they have proven who they are.</p><p><strong>Part 1 of Notarization - Signer Identity Verification</strong></p><p>The first part of the notary process happens when a user verifies their identity through one or more of the following ways: email, social, government ID, or address verification. Identity verification changes a user\u2019s trust <a href="#Levels">level</a>. The trust <a href="#Levels">level</a> a user has when they notarize an asset is inserted into that asset\u2019s metadata and appended to the blockchain.</p><p>Note: If the user later changes their trust <a href="#Levels">level</a>, the assets they notarized prior to the change will still reflect their previous trust <a href="#Levels">level</a>, i.e. the trust <a href="#Levels">level</a> the user had when they originally notarized that specific asset. For example, say a user notarizes an asset when they had a trust <a href="#Levels">level</a> of 2, but they later upgraded their trust <a href="#Levels">level</a> to 3. When that asset is authenticated, it would return metadata saying the notarizing user had a trust <a href="#Levels">level</a> of 2, even after the user upgraded their trust <a href="#Levels">level</a>. This is why you want to verify your identity at the highest trust <a href="#Levels">level</a> before you start notarizing assets.</p><p><strong>Part 2 of Notarization - Testifying to an Asset\u2019s Trustworthiness</strong></p><p>Codenotary allows users to independently testify to an asset\u2019s trust <a href="#Statuses">status</a> and immutably store their attestation on the blockchain through the notarization process. The notary process is initiated by a user (the signer) and executed by running the command:</p><ul><li><code>vcn notarize</code> which sets the asset\u2019s <a href="#Statuses">status</a> equal to <strong>TRUSTED</strong></li></ul><p>(Subsequent changes in status are revocations of trust. See the section below on Revocation for more information.)</p><p><strong>Part 3 of Notarization - Creating Asset Metadata and Recording it on the Blockchain</strong></p>',10),u=t("When the signer initiates the notarization process, their block of digital data ("),g=e("em",null,"the asset",-1),f=t(") is input into a "),p={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=t("SHA-256"),b=t(" hashing function in order to produce their asset\u2019s unique digital fingerprint.
