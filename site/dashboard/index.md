# Codenotary Dashboard

With Codenotary Dashboard you can monitor and manage your account and all of its signed assets. Once an asset has been signed, it will appear in the owner’s dashboard along with the other assets in the asset portfolio. The dashboard shows how many times an asset has been verified, when it was signed, its public visibility, trust status, history (how an asset’s trust status has changed over time) and more.
