# Dashboard

## Top Assets

In this section you will be able to see your top assets, the number of authentications they have had, when they were notarized, their public visibility, and more.
Use this screen when you need to quickly check assets stats as well as an itemized list of all of your assets, their trust statuses, and the number of asset signatures you have revoked due to bugs, obsolescence, or depreciation.

You can show and hide the asset list columns by clicking on the 'vertical dots' icon at the end of the asset table's headline and selecting which columns you want to see. The dashboard application automatically saves these settings into your browser's localstorage.


## Top 10 Assets

You see this section only when you don't have own notarized assets yet. Top 10 Assets shows the top notarized assets in the Codenotary.io system.

## Timeline

The timeline feed shows different kinds of events generated in the Codenotary.io system:

- User events like registering, first login, etc.
- Asset-related events - everytime you notarize, authenticate your assets
