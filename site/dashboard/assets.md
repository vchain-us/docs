# My Assets

### What is an asset?
In Codenotary terms, an asset is anything digital that is made up of 1’s and 0’s. Of course, the binary level is as base as it gets and there are scaled degrees of larger digital scaffolding of all sizes including snippets, images, containers, programs, apps, backups, etc. All assets can have their digital integrity authenticated anytime, anywhere. And Codenotary’s dashboard makes it easy to manage all your assets in the same place.

## Verified counter
Displays the number of authentications (on your assets)

## Signed counter
Displays the number of assets signed by you


## Group Assets by Hash

You are able to easily visualize your asset versions by turning on the ‘Group by Asset’ feature for a cleaner dashboard experience. This will group all versions of the same asset together by matching their hashes together. The latest signed version will always be presented first. Clicking the down arrow icon to the left of the asset’s name will cause the asset timeline to display and open up an accordion view of the asset history as shown below.


## Search

Search in your assets by (file)name. Start to type the filename and the asset list will show the filtered results immediately.


## Asset details

Click on the little ‘i’ icon to the far right in the row of a specific asset, a detail page will pop up with all the asset’s details, including metadata and custom attributes.


## Export Assets

You can easily export the asset list into csv format. Click on the 'File - download' icon in the top right corner of the list and a csv file will start to download with every asset you see in your asset list.

## Howto check the Blockchain transaction

There might be situations where you want to know if and where the notarization transaction happened on the [ZTC blockchain](https://www.zerotrustconsortium.org).
In that case we got you covered, as you can click on the transaction details icon next to the notarized digital asset:

![Transaction](./img/asset-transaction-view.png "Notarization transaction")

![Transaction details](./img/transaction-view.png "Notarization transaction details")

You'll be forwarded to the ZTC Blockchain explorer and the transaction you clicked on:

You can also copy the input data to your clipboard to convert it into human readable data.
Simply paste (1) the copied input data into [decode service of Codenotary](https://decode.codenotary.io) and click decode (2) and select the hash value (3) to see even more details:
