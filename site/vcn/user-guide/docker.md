# Default Docker Integration

`vcn` supports local docker installations out of the box using `docker://` as a location. You just need to point to the correct container image name or the container image id.

If you prefer [podman](https://podman.io/), just use `podman://` instead.


### Notarize a local docker image

`vcn` uses docker default schemes, so the latest tag is automatically used, if no tag is given

```
vcn notarize docker://hello-world
```

or using a tag

```
vcn notarize docker://hello-world:v1
```

To be able to notarize, you need to register at [Codenotary](https://dashboard.codenotary.io) and get an account.

### Authenticate a local docker image

```
vcn authenticate docker://hello-world
```

or using a tag

```
vcn authenticate docker://hello-world:v1
```

# Docker Sidecar Integration

`vcn` also offers a sidecar project, you can use to automatically authenticate used container images during runtime.

Check out (https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-watchdog) on your server. The tool continuously verifies the integrity of your containers:

```
git clone https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-watchdog.git 
```

Edit the verify file and set the alerting/monitoring tool you are using (see the following instructions), if you want to change the alerting

Make sure `/var/run/docker.sock` is accessible and run the following command on your server within the [vcn-watchdog](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-watchdog.git) directory.
``` 
docker-compose build && docker-compose up 
```

To modify the verify file, hook up your alerting tool into the err() function. 

Example using Slack, do the following:

* Create a Slack Bot (Slack documentation here) 
* Use the following code: 

```
function err() {
    echo "Container ${1} (${2}) verification failed" >&2
    curl -q -X POST \
        -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data "{\"text\":\"Container ${1} (${2}) verification failed\"}" \
        "https://hooks.slack.com/services/$TOKEN/$KEY" > /dev/null 2>&1} 
```

If all works well, you should receive slack messages in your slack channel
